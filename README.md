# intermediate-algorithms-freecodecamp
My solutions to intermediate algorithms from freecodecamp.org

All of these solutions will accomplish the given task. Some of them may not be the best or the most efficient way to solve the given problem, but this is how I made them the first time. I will keep them like this, with all their imperfections so that I can come back to them later and improve them.
